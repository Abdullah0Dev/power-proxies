<!--
! what to do?
1. plan what am going to work on
2. make an overview of what am gonna do inshallah
3. high light some points(if needed) and specify the elements that I'd focus on
4. make it as a goal... try to end it in a specfic time inshallah cuz I need to work faster
5. start working on the points... - get a design then work on it
* بسم الله توكلت علي الله


-> what do we need to show?
1. last 10 people visited website showing: Device, Country, OS, Browser
2. show user information and their setting with a small thing & speed test
3. Sales overview charts - Visit Cluster by device
4. users country - top 5 countries

* => user proxies implements
get the the email/username from the client -> then make a mongodb data base for this specific user which is gonna be with listing his own bought proxies with its data.. and make expire data.. then it deleted automatically -> then he need to renew the proxy

* => finding the proxy that are not rented..
if a proxy is not associated with a client so it's gonna be available.. if not it's already in use (in admin side brief)
? => todays plan inshallah:
1. finalize the website 
  //• make the dark mode/light mode
  /• fix any problem or issue
 // • end the dashboard sidebar 
2. backend selling workings
  • enable the usr to purchase and make his own proxies based on his email
  //• make the analysis routers from CheckStat.net
  • connect the frontend with the backend
  • deploy the changes and make the client take a look but hide some to show it to him later in the week inshallah
  • organize the selling based on client admin page which enable him to manage which proxy is available or not
  • cool.... no let's have a chat   
-> dashboard - logo, - Statistics
 Plans - goals inshallah
// 1. do the client schema which is gonna be when a email exist it's gonna assign with an email.. so he can know what he have and so on... it's element is gonna be as the website elements
